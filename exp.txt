Я русский
Я вдыхаю этот воздух
Солнце в небе смотрит на меня
Надо мной летает вольный ветер
Он такой же, как и я
И хочется просто любить и дышать
И мне другого не нужно
Такой, какой есть, и меня не сломать
И всё потому что
Я русский, я иду до конца
Я русский, моя кровь от отца, xeй
Я русский, и мне повезло
Я русский всему миру назло
Я русский
В небо улетает эта песня
И зовёт меня с собой
А во мне пылает моё сердце
Освещая путь домой
Где хочется просто любить и дышать
И мне другого не нужно
Такой уж я есть, и меня не сломать
И всё потому что
Я русский, я иду до конца
Я русский, моя кровь от отца, xeй
Я русский, и мне повезло
Я русский всему миру назло
Я русский
Я русский, я иду до конца
Я русский, моя кровь от отца
Я русский, и мне повезло
Я русский всему миру назло
Я рyсский

============================
Early Life

Winston Churchill came from a long line of English aristocrat-politicians. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was descended from the First Duke of Marlborough and was himself a well-known figure in Tory politics in the 1870s and 1880s.

His mother, born Jennie Jerome, was an American heiress whose father was a stock speculator and part-owner of The New York Times. (Rich American girls like Jerome who married European noblemen were known as “dollar princesses.”)

Did you know? Sir Winston Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953 for his six-volume history of World War II.

Churchill was born at the family’s estate near Oxford on November 30, 1874. He was educated at the Harrow prep school, where he performed so poorly that he did not even bother to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. Instead, in 1893 young Winston Churchill headed off to military school at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

Battles and Books

After he left Sandhurst, Churchill traveled all around the British Empire as a soldier and as a journalist. In 1896, he went to India; his first book, published in 1898, was an account of his experiences in India’s Northwest Frontier Province.

In 1899, the London Morning Post sent him to cover the Boer War in South Africa, but he was captured by enemy soldiers almost as soon as he arrived. (News of Churchill’s daring escape through a bathroom window made him a minor celebrity back home in Britain.)

By the time he returned to England in 1900, the 26-year-old Churchill had published five books.

Churchill: “Crossing the Chamber”

That same year, Winston Churchill joined the House of Commons as a Conservative. Four years later, he “crossed the chamber” and became a Liberal.

His work on behalf of progressive social reforms such as an eight-hour workday, a government-mandated minimum wage, a state-run labor exchange for unemployed workers and a system of public health insurance infuriated his Conservative colleagues, who complained that this new Churchill was a traitor to his class.

Churchill and Gallipoli

In 1911, Churchill turned his attention away from domestic politics when he became the First Lord of the Admiralty (akin to the Secretary of the Navy in the U.S.). Noting that Germany was growing more and more bellicose, Churchill began to prepare Great Britain for war: He established the Royal Naval Air Service, modernized the British fleet and helped invent one of the earliest tanks.
